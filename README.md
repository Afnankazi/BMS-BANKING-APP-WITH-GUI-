## Lessons Learned

During the development of FundWise, several key lessons were learned that significantly contributed to the project's success:

### 1. Connecting PostgreSQL Database in Java

Learning to connect a PostgreSQL database with Java was a crucial aspect of the project. Understanding how to establish a connection, execute queries, and handle transactions provided valuable insight into database integration within Java applications. This knowledge laid the foundation for efficient data management and retrieval in FundWise.

### 2. Utilizing Different Inbuilt Java Libraries

Exploring and utilizing various inbuilt Java libraries, such as Timer and SimpleDateFormat, proved to be highly beneficial. The Timer class enabled the implementation of scheduled tasks and periodic updates within the application, enhancing its functionality and user experience. Similarly, the SimpleDateFormat class facilitated the parsing and formatting of dates, ensuring consistency and clarity in displaying time-sensitive information.

### 3. Creating Modern GUI with Java Swing

Developing a modern and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing was a significant learning experience. By leveraging Swing components, layout managers, and event handling mechanisms, we were able to design an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface for FundWise. This process involved understanding principles of UI design, responsiveness, and usability, which ultimately resulted in an engaging and seamless banking experience for users.

In summary, the development of FundWise provided valuable insights into database integration, utilization of Java libraries, and GUI design principles. These lessons learned not only enriched our technical skills but also contributed to the successful implementation of a robust and user-centric banking application.
